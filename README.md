# Arduino Board Controlled Drip (ABCD) Irrigation System
This is a smart irrigation system where the water is fed to the field depending upon the moisture level of the Soil
## Why we need this smart irrigation system
- Firstly, It will automate the process of checking the moisture level of soil to give water to the plants.
- Secondly, Different types of plants have different requirements of water they need. So, by adjusting a certain moisture level value to a particular plant, it can fulfill the water demand of plants.
- Thirdly, The program is written in such a way where it can be used for any number of different plants using a single water resource
